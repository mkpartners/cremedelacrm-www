In the latest episode of “Q &amp; A with Matt K!”, we dive into an issue with outdated images appearing in the (already updated) letterhead of Flow-launched emails!

Trailblazer community member Ellen brought up this interesting (and familiar) problem. She had updated an email letterhead with a new logo, but noticed that while most templates reflected this change, a few stubborn ones did not. These templates were being sent via a Flow, and despite thorough checks, the inconsistency persisted.
{{< image src="/img/1_ygA1kJSAi2ZRVYtIuVn_Ug.png" title="Image" >}}

**Ellen’s Question:** **“How do I get ALL email templates to use the correct letterhead? I have updated an email letterhead with a new logo. Most of the email templates using this letterhead get sent with the new logo, however, there are a couple that are not getting the new logo. The emails are being sent using a flow. No changes were made to any of the email templates, yet some have the new logo and some do not. When I preview the templates that are getting sent incorrectly, they look fine and have the new logo. But when I trigger them with the flow, they appear incorrect in my inbox. I have double-checked the logo document in Classic and the static resource in LE. I have also double-checked the letterhead and all the templates that use it.”**

Matt walked and talked his way through the troubleshooting and, ultimately, recommended this:

**Matt’s Solution:**
<ol><li>**Timing and Cache Issues:** Sometimes, these issues resolve themselves over time due to caching. Waiting a few hours or days can sometimes fix the problem.</li></ol>
OR

If that’s not it/there’s not time to waste:
<ol><li>**Create a New Letterhead:** Create a completely new letterhead with the updated logo.</li><li>**Update the Templates:** Ensure all templates are updated to use this new letterhead.</li><li>**Delete the Old Image:** To be thorough, delete the old image from your files if it’s not used elsewhere. This prevents any accidental misapplication.</li></ol>
