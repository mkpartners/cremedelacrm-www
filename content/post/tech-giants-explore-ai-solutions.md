With the rise of AI products and services over the past two years (and a lifetime’s worth of news written about the subject) it makes sense to take a quick look at what products are available from those brands we know best in the world of tech! You’ve heard of them but do you know what AI products they have to offer and how they are being used today?

Let’s Find Out!

## Amazon (SageMaker)

The largest online e-commerce platform and cloud computing solution enters the AI industry with a solution to help people and businesses easily create and use machine learning (ML) models. Companies, Data Scientists, Developers, Researchers, and small businesses may find it useful for a variety of use cases. SageMaker combines all the necessary tools in one place, making complex tasks simpler. While some basic knowledge of programming and machine learning is helpful, SageMaker provides resources and tutorials to help anyone get started, making advanced technology more accessible to use all.
