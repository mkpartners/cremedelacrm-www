Our coverage continues as more and more community conferences take center stage this month. Formerly known as NorCal Dreamin’, the 8th iteration of this in-person event brings Admins, Developers, Architects, Partners, Consultants, and Trailblazers together to share experiences, build new relationships, and explore innovations.

Attendees can enjoy workshops, breakout sessions, sponsor perks, and happy hour networking throughout various locations at [Tahoe Dreamin’](https://tahoedreamin.com/).

This year, once again, the event will take place at [Harrah’s Lake Tahoe](https://www.caesars.com/harrahs-tahoe) and officially kicks off on Thursday, July 25th, with check-in, badge pickup, and sponsor setups on Wed, 24th.

## What to Expect (Weather Wise)

Here’s what’s in store weather-wise for Lake Tahoe, NV (but it’s right on the CA border) this week! Mid-to-high-80s weather during the day, followed by a low-60s leading up to the night. Make sure to pack some light jackets to keep you warm if it gets too cold. Don’t forget your pair of comfy shoes to keep your feet nice and relaxed.

## The “Demo Jam” Continues

Demo Jam’s been going strong for years and will do so once again this go ‘round. A competition that requires various ISVs/SIs to go head-to-head to demo their Apps in 3-minute presentations. Attendees will then have a chance to vote for their favorite and pick a winner.

We should anticipate some crafty demos with fashionably relevant (though occasionally questionable) attire.

## The Agenda

The event will start with a relaxed check-in on Wednesday, July 24th, and some networking events at local hotspots the night before the big kickoff. Make sure to check the TD24 Slack channel to find out where the next meet-up is going to take place. It’s a small town and everything is within walking distance. (For the most part).

Thursday, July 25th begins with the opening keynote, followed by a diverse series of sessions and the BBQ lunch around noon which will allow you to snag some epic pictures of the Lake and its surroundings. Make sure to attend to enjoy the ambiance.

Come right back downstairs and engage with sponsors throughout the day as more sessions continue to take place before the evening happy hour and other networking activities take place throughout the night. (Or until you need to call it quits).

Friday, July 26th offers some early bird sessions, and hands-on workshops before the closing keynote starts around noon.

But there’s more, want to stay over the weekend and do more after the event? Explore Lake Tahoe with fellow Trailblazers and organizers through various activities. Make new connections with activities starting early morning on Saturday, July 27th.

Don’t miss this opportunity to learn, network, and enjoy! Make sure to review your agenda and attend as many activities as possible around the [schedule](https://tahoedreamin.com/schedule/) for each day.

## Participate And Win

Once again “Sponsor Bingo” will make an appearance with a suite of prizes you will want to win. From Stanley Mugs, Salesforce T-shirts, a Salesforce Plushy, Event Tickets, and More! There is something for everyone.

Make sure to complete your cards and follow the instructions provided by the staff. Winners should be announced after the event concludes on Friday the 26th.

## In-Person Networking Opportunities

This event provides activities before, during, and after the event to enjoy with Trailblazers. Whether you are reconnecting with an existing friend or colleague to meeting someone face-to-face for the first time. Tahoe provides attendees with a chance to engage more in down-to-earth conversations with the person right next to them.

Wine, beer, and other drinks along with some appetizers and food may be served during each activity but vary from place to place. Leverage these moments to learn more and make connections that may nudge your career opportunities to their next level.
