Remember having to call customer service? Manually searching through files (or paper manuals!) to troubleshoot an issue? Brainstorming marketing ideas with pen and paper? How about visiting a travel agency (in person!) to book your next vacation, or repeated trips to the library to find the right research to support your paper.

Technology has changed how we do almost everything and, with AI, the revolution seems set to continue!

Pretty soon, it seems, the tech will be doing some of those “everyday” tasks for you!

Let’s look at how AI Autonomous Agents might help simplify things in the future.

## What is an Autonomous AI Agent?

Autonomous AI agents are an advanced form of artificial intelligence designed to perform tasks and make decisions independently, without human intervention. They learn from data and experiences to make decisions based on predefined criteria or learned patterns. They automate their tasks and adapt to their environments and requirements. With time they become more efficient and independent of human oversight.

Areas where you might see these agents deployed are customer service, sales, marketing, data analysis, and operations efforts. A very simple version of an agent could be a chatbot on your favorite site. They help you answer questions about an existing order or request an RMA to return something no longer needed.

No matter the case the goal and purpose of an Autonomous AI Agent is to be independent of human oversight while helping humans accomplish daily tasks.

## The Challenges?

The output, data accuracy, transparency, and ethical practices are some of the concerns to address when implementing, deploying, and utilizing AI. So, it's no surprise that these will also apply to Autonomous agents.

Salesforce Einstein is an example of an AI algorithm that is working day in and day out to apply CRM + Data + Trust into their entire AI algorithm to create a unified source of truth.

This [article](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/ai-training-trust/) further breaks down some of the reasons why Trust and Training are essential to successful AI Autonomous agents.

And, if Trust is an essential building block, then Training and Oversight are its predecessors. The data used to train them, the humans interacting with them and those overseeing them play a crucial role in contributing, and developing the AI’s abilities to achieve its goal and purpose.

## Conclusion

Autonomous AI agents present an opportunity for AI and humans to learn from each other. Humans train the AI to ensure it fulfills its purpose while being able to leverage AI resources and ability to complete tasks in a faster, simpler, and straightforward approach.

At the same time, AI needs to adapt to understand the various types of users it will interact with. Building Autonomous Agents that humans can trust and that can be be trained to adapt to new and existing users will put AI one step closer in the right direction.

What aspect of your day to day life are you most excited to see an autonomous AI be able to tackle for you. Let us know in the comments!

Until next time keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!
