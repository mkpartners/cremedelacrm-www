That “25” feels crazy to see up there, but disbelief won’t slow the passage of time and, as the calendar’s flip over to August this week, that can only mean one thing — the Salesforce Winter ’25 release is on the way! As always, we’ll be peppering the lead-up to launch with another round of Release Highlights posts to show-off our picks for the most-anticipated updates, upgrades, and new features, and today we’ll be talking through the timeline so you can be sure to not miss a thing in this release cycle.

Let’s dive in!

## Sandbox Previews Go Live — August 31st

If you’re taking advantage of the sandbox preview, it looks they’re going live at the end of August so you’ll be able to take all the new features for a test spin! Sandbox previews are our greatest source of accurately evaluating just how valuable individual updates are going to be to our org, and our clients’ orgs, so it’s definitely worth the time if you get the chance.

## Release Notes Go Live — (Likely) August 14th

The release notes are typically the main event (and mark the kickoff point of our “Highlights” posts) and, while we don’t have a clear date yet, based on previous releases we’re likely to see them drop on August 14th! And, as soon as they do, we’ll update this post with a link to them on the release site!

## Release Site Goes Live — (Likely) August 31st

Lots of folks start with the release notes, but what if you’re looking for a Trailhead module to walk you through the release in a clear, digestible, slightly-gamified way? Well the 31st likely marks the launch of the release readiness website with short videos, helpful demos, and a whole module designed to impart the most knowledge with the least amount of friction, whatever your preferred learning style!

## Release Readiness LIVE Broadcast — (Likely) October 9–11

The admin and developer evangelists will kick off the Winter ’25 Release with another round of “Release Readiness Live”! Then, the product management team will discuss and demo the new features. We’ll get to see how those features work in real time and get a sneak peek into the roadmap for the rest of 2025!

## Winter ’25 Go Live

And finally, the main event! When can you expect Winter ’25 to be live in your production environment. It depends a bit on your org ID, but the release is being broken out into 3 main sweeps, a super-limited pilot program first, and then two much wider releases before it’s in orgs everywhere:

**TBD — First Release Weekend (Limited, Pilot participation)**

**Oct. 5 — Second Release Weekend**

**Oct. 12 — Final Release Weekend**

Be sure to review our guide on how to check exactly when you can expect the update on your end and, as always, the complete list of orgs, updates, and timelines is available on the [Salesforce Trust page](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/winter-22-sandbox-preview/#:~:text=gets%20upgraded.%20Our-,Trust,-page%20has%20the)!

As always, we’ll be doing another round of Release Highlights posts and videos as we countdown to launch, so stay tuned for our picks for favorite new features and, if you have any of your own, feel free to drop them in the comments.

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.
