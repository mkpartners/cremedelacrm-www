This year, once again, the event will take place at the [Hyatt Regency](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-regency/en-US/msprm-hyatt-regency-minneapolis) and officially begins prep today, Wednesday, July 17th, with sponsor/setup, badge pickup, and then kickoff the main event in the afternoon!

## What to Expect (Weather Wise)

Here’s what’s in store weather-wise for Minneapolis, MN this week! Mid-to-high-70s weather during the day, followed by a cool low-60s leading up to the night. Not bad if you ask me, so make sure to pack some light jackets to keep you warm if it gets cold. Don’t forget to always take a pair of comfortable shoes as well since you will be walking more than usual.

## MWD Demo Jam Champion

Their “Coveted Demo Jam” never fails to make an appearance at Midwest Dreamin’ and does so once more this year. A multi-round competition that requires various ISVs/SIs to go head-to-head to demo their Apps in 3-minute intervals. The first round kicks off on Thursday, July 18th.

Attendees will have a chance to vote for their favorite and pick a winner. Participants go above and beyond to create experiences to be crowned the Demo Jam Champion. We should anticipate some crafty demos with fashionably relevant (though occasionally questionable) attire.

## The Agenda

This event takes a different approach by opening later during the first day and ending earlier on the last day. Sponsors take advantage of setting things up on that first day during the first half between 8 am and 12 pm, then registration and the expo hall open right at noon. Sessions start from 1 pm until 5 pm followed by the Opening Keynote. Once that’s a wrap enjoy the opening reception and happy hour activities.

The next day, July 18th, attendees can enter the expo at 8 am. Sessions will continue to take place along with the Demo Jam Rounds, Lunch, and much more. Make sure to network with others to find out where to catch the next gathering.

On the final day, the remaining sessions will take place along with the Closing Keynote. Then the wrapup will include a <strong>10th Anniversary Slideshow </strong>which should include<strong> </strong>a<strong> </strong>collection of memories to share and remember for many years to come.

Make sure to review your agenda to plan and attend as many activities as possible.
