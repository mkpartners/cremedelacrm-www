We’re eagerly awaiting the release notes, ready to spin up our sandboxes, and, so excited for the Winter ’25 Release to roll into production. And with all that comes a question that rolls around three times every year: “When exactly can I expect our **org** to get updated?”

Thankfully it’s gotten even easier to check when you’ll be able to enjoy all the new features and tweaks you’re most excited about. What used to involve checking your instance number against a matrix of dates and possibilities, now has a simple-one-stop solution: [status.salesforce.com](https://status.salesforce.com/)

Simply navigate over to [status.salesforce.com](https://status.salesforce.com/) and enter your instance number in the search box.

**(Note: If you need help remembering your instance number, just navigate to “company information” from “Setup” and you’ll find it listed there.)**

So, once you’ve searched your instance on [status.salesforce.com](http://status.salesforce.com/), select it from the results.

Just don’t forget to update your calendar afterwards!

And, of course stay tuned here for further Release coverage, highlights, videos, demos, and more!

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud!
