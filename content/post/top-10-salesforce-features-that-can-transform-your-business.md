When you think of Salesforce, you probably think of your own experience using the platform in the roles you’ve explored throughout your career. If you’re in sales, you likely spend a lot of time with Leads and Opportunities, if you’re in Service: Cases and Accounts, etc… But every once in a while you’ll land in a role or at an org that’s using features of the platform you didn’t even know existed! Or maybe you knew/had heard about, but didn’t realize how potentially valuable they were!

In today’s post, we’ll take a look at some of Salesforce’s less-frequently-celebrated features that can really improve business productivity and performance when used effectively!

Let’s dive in!
